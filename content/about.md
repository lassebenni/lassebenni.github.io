I'm Lasse Benninga, a Data & Analytics Engineer with 7+ years of experience building data platforms and automation pipelines across AWS, GCP, and Azure. I've worked with companies like KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Vattenfall, and Felyx, where I've architected and implemented scalable data solutions using everything from managing cloud infrastructure with Terraform to building data warehouses with Snowflake and dbt.

I believe building robust CI/CD pipelines and automation solutions is essential for streamlining development, reducing debugging time, and saving costs for clients. This technical blog focuses on practical guides and automation patterns across data engineering and devops, with concise write-ups featuring reproducible steps and code.
