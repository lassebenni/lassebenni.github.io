I'm Lasse, a Data & Analytics Engineer based in the Netherlands with 7+ years of experience building data platforms and automation pipelines across AWS, GCP, and Azure. I've worked with companies like KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Vattenfall, and Felyx, where I've architected and implemented scalable data solutions using everything from managing cloud infrastructure with Terraform to building data warehouses with Snowflake and dbt.

This technical blog focuses on practical guides and automation patterns across data and analytics engineering. I try to keep it it consise and TLDR-proof!
